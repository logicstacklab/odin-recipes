Recipe Website Project

This project is a personal recipe website that I developed as part of my learning journey with The Odin Project. The recipes on this site were inspired by Academia della Cucina.

I worked on building the HTML page from scratch, adding structured content including paragraphs and headings, embedding links to web pages, and integrating images with proper photo credits.

Features

Browse and view recipes with images and descriptions.

Structured content with headings and paragraphs for better readability.

Links to external resources and properly credited images.

Purpose

The main goal of this project was to practice HTML and web development fundamentals, including page structure, content organization, linking, and image integration, while creating a recipe website inspired by Academia della Cucina.
