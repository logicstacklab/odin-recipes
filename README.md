Recipe Website Project

This project is a personal recipe website that I developed for practice and learning. The recipes on this site were inspired by Academia della Cucina.

The site allows users to browse and explore various recipes in a clean and user-friendly interface. While the recipes are inspired by Academia della Cucina, the design and implementation of the site are entirely my own.

Features

Browse and view recipes with images and descriptions.

Purpose

The main goal of this project was to practice web development and learn how to build a recipe website while using Academia della Cucina as inspiration for content.
