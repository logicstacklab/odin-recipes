        </li>
        <li>
            Tomato paste (double-concentrated): 1 tbsp
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup (1 glass) of whole milk (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
            Light meat or vegetable broth (or stock cubes)
        </li>
        <li>
            Extra virgin olive oil: 3 tbsp
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt and pepper
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a heavy-bottomed casserole or Dutch oven (24–26 cm / 10 inches), gently melt the chopped pancetta with the olive oil over low heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop the onion, carrot, and celery using a knife only. Add them to the pan and cook slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon, until softened but not browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase the heat to medium, add the ground beef, and break it up. Cook for about ten minutes, stirring frequently, until the meat is lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the wine and let it cook until fully evaporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the tomato paste and strained tomatoes. Add one cup of hot broth or water, cover, and let the sauce simmer gently for about two hours (up to three, depending on preference), adding more liquid as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            If using milk, add it halfway through the cooking time and allow it to fully evaporate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with salt and pepper at the end. The finished sauce should be thick, glossy, and a deep reddish-brown color.
        </li>
    </ol>
