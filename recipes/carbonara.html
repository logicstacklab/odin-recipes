    <h2>Origin of Carbonara Pasta</h2>
    <p>The recipe is considered to originate from Rome. It belongs to a family of pasta dishes with cured pork, cheese, and pepper, and may have evolved from earlier dishes like pasta cacio e uova or pasta alla gricia. The name “carbonara” first appeared in print in 1950, linked to a pasta dish popular among American officers after the liberation of Rome in 1944.</p>
    <p>Carbonara pasta (in Italian: pasta alla carbonara) is a culinary specialty made with pasta, most often spaghetti, coated in an emulsion of a little pasta cooking water with grated pecorino cheese and egg yolks, then served with black pepper and guanciale, cut into small pieces.</p>
